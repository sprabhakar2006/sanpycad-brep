app.py -- launches SanPyCAD Brep, the OpenSCAD-like desktop application.

This is the B-rep-first copy of SanPyCAD: unlike the main app and
SanPyCAD Experimental (both mesh-based -- everything ends up as
triangle soup), scripts here build on backend/brep.py, which wraps
build123d/OpenCASCADE (OCCT) to produce genuine boundary-representation
(B-rep) solids -- exact analytic/NURBS surfaces, exact booleans, real
STEP file export. The 3D viewer still renders triangles (that's all
WebGL can ever draw), but they're a disposable tessellation generated
just for display -- the actual model stays exact B-rep the whole time.
Its window title, launcher names, and console/log output are all
labeled "SanPyCAD Brep" specifically so it's never confused with the
other two when installed side by side.

This starts the local geometry backend (backend/server.py, built on
build123d via backend/brep.py) and opens it in its own application window
using pywebview, so this behaves like a normal desktop app rather than "go
start a server and open your browser". If pywebview isn't installed, it
transparently falls back to opening your default browser instead -- the
app still works, just as a browser tab.

Normally you don't need to run this file directly -- just double-click
SanPyCAD Brep.app (in the same folder as this file) to launch it
like any other desktop app, no Terminal/command line needed. This is
what that shortcut actually runs under the hood; it's still runnable by
hand too if you ever want to:
    python3 app.py

To get the native window (recommended), install pywebview first:
    pip install pywebview

    # (a new window) -- and if that copy's own first render also spawns
    # a worker, IT does the same thing, cascading into windows opening
    # one after another with no end. A no-op on macOS/Linux (which fork
    # instead) and when running from source (not frozen), so it's safe
    # to always call unconditionally here.
