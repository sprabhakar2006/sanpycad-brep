"""
bundle_paths.py -- path plumbing used ONLY by the frozen (PyInstaller)
build of SanPyCAD Brep. Running from source never imports this file.

Two things change when the app is frozen into a bundle:

1. Where the app's own files live. From source, app.py sits next to
   backend/, frontend/ and examples/. Inside a bundle those are copied
   into PyInstaller's resource directory (sys._MEIPASS: Contents/
   Frameworks on macOS, _internal\\ on Windows), which is somewhere
   else entirely and is NOT next to the executable the user clicked.

2. Where the app is allowed to WRITE. A bundle is meant to be
   read-only: /Applications on macOS needs an admin password to write
   into, and C:\\Program Files on Windows needs elevation. This app
   writes much less at runtime than the main SanPyCAD app does -- it
   has no sanpycad_config.json and no imports/ folder (those are a
   SanPyCAD-only concept; see that app's own bundle_paths.py) -- but
   it still writes its own session log, and frontend/vendor/ is
   normally fetched into the app's own folder on first run. Both are
   redirected to the per-user application data folder, which always
   exists and is always writable:

       macOS    ~/Library/Application Support/SanPyCAD Brep
       Windows  %APPDATA%\\SanPyCAD Brep
       Linux    ~/.local/share/SanPyCAD Brep  (XDG_DATA_HOME if set)
